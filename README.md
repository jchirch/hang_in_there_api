# README

## Abstract
This program is used to add CRUD functionality to a BE API application. This can be used to build a database that FE developers can use rather than hard coding their own data.

- Ruby version: ruby 3.2.2

## Learning Goals
We aimed to gain a deeper understanding of servers, SQL, ActiveRecord, and learning the back end properties of building an application. 

Specifically:

- Expose an API
- Use serializers to format JSON responses
- Test API exposure
- Use SQL and AR to gather data
- Breaking down a problem into small steps
- Practice individual research (articles, videos, mentors)

## Installation

1. Fork and clone [this repo](https://github.com/jchirch/hang_in_there_api) in a new directory.
2. Connect to an API platform (Postman or a similar platform).
3. In your CLI run `rails db:{create,migrate,seed}`.
4. In your CLI run `rails server`.
5. In your API Platform of choice, connect to the server and interact with data with HTTP Methods to suite individual needs.

## Testing

- For RSpec coverage run: `bundle exec rspec spec/requests`
- For visualization of SimpleCov run: `open coverage/index.html `
